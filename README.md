### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Heya! I'm Wyatt! I'm a neurodivergent teen who spends too much time coding, learning languages, and decompiling games. I have ADHD, BPD, and probably a fuckload of undiagnosed shit. I speak English, French, and the constructed language toki pona, and I'm learning spanish.

I also spend a lot of time fucking around with admin-installed-extension-bypassing exploits 

So, as you can tell, I'm a massive nerd and I wear that on my sleeve. If you ever wanna talk to me, I'm @panwaja on discord!
